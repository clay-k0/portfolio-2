# Ematchi

This is a memory matching game that you're probably familiar with, but with emojis. It's built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and it's hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). This one features a timer as well as difficulty settings.

## How to play

Click on a card to flip it over. Click on another card to flip it over. If the emojis match, they'll stay flipped over. If they don't, they'll flip back over. Match all the cards to win. If the timer runs out, you lose. You can change the difficulty settings to make the game easier or harder.

## How to run locally

To run this locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Once you have those installed, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone github.com/clay-k0/ematchi
cd ematchi
npm install
npm run dev
```
