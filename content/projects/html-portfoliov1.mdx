# portfolio v1

This is the portfolio i used before this one. It was made with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and it is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The design is rather simple, even more so than this one, but i still like it.

## How to run locally

To run this portfolio, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Once you have those, you can run the following commands:

```bash
git clone github.com/clay-k0/portfolio
cd portfolio
npm install
npm start
```
