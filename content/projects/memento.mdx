# Memento

This is another memory matching game, similar to Ematchi, but this time with tech icons. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and it's hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). This one's a little more barebones, but it functions just as well, and is PWA compatible.

## How to play

Click on a card to flip it over. Click on another card to flip it over. If the icons match, they'll stay flipped over. If they don't, they'll flip back over. Match all the cards to win.

## How to run locally

To run this locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Once you have those installed, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone github.com/clay-k0/memento
cd memento
npm install
npm run dev
```
