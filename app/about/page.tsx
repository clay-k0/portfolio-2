                    hey there! i'm clayton, a 20 year old computer science
                    student who is also learning web development. i'm just about
                    a semester away from being a junior at old dominion
                    university, and i'm passionate about learning new
                    technologies and building projects that solve real-world
                    problems. when it comes to libraries/frameworks, i'm most
                    familiar with react and next.js, but i'm currently learning
                    svelte and sveltekit. outside of programming, i enjoy
                    listening to music, collecting vinyl, spending time with
                    family and friends, and cycling outside. if you ever want to
                    reach out or just chat, head to the{" "}

                    section to send me an email; i'm always looking for new
                    opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
